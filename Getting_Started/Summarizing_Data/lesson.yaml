- Class: text
  Output: "Now that you can create vectors of data, we will learn how to explore and summarize them. 
  In this lesson you will use functions that provide key information, statistics, or visualizations 
  to help you better understand your data."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Lets start with a vector we can practice on. We have provided you with a vector of average
     annual precipitation (in inches) in some US cities, called `precip`. Enter `precip` to look at it now. 
     Note that each element is named."
  CorrectAnswer: precip
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='precip')
  Hint: Type the name of the vector and press Enter. 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Confirm that this is truly a vector (remember is.object_type). 
  CorrectAnswer: is.vector(precip)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='is.vector(precip)')
  Hint: The function you will need is is.vector() and your argument is precip.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Rainfall in inches is foolish---the rest of the scientific community uses millimeters, 
      so we will too! Create a new object called 'precip_mm' by multiplying your precip vector by 25.4"
  CorrectAnswer: precip_mm <- precip * 25.4
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('precip_mm <- precip*25.4', 'precip_mm <- 25.4*precip')
  Hint: "Remember that multiplying a vector by a single number will apply the multiplication to each 
  element of that vector." 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Nice work! When working with data 
  objects in R, it is important to know their details, so lets look at them. One of the 
  most important functions for data analysis in R is `str( )`, which stands for structure. It will 
  tell us about our data object. Go ahead and look at the structure of precip_mm"
  CorrectAnswer: str(precip_mm)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='str(precip_mm)')
  Hint: The function you need is str(), and the argument is your precipitation vector (in mm)
  
- Class: text
  Output: "In this case, `str( )` is telling us that our vector is numeric (`num`), has 70 elements in it 
  (`[1:70]`, meaning 70 observations), and shows us the first handful of elements in the vector. It is also 
  telling us that each element has a name associated with it, and that those names are of the character
  data type (`Named num` and `attr(*, 'names')= chr`)."
  
- Class: text
  Output: "You will use `str()` a lot when you start working with more complex data objects such as 
      lists and dataframes and the output of regression models."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "But lets get to some actual statistics. A statistic we often want to know about our 
    samples is the average, or mean. R has a built-in function: `mean()`. Go ahead and use `mean()` 
    to find the average precipitation across all cities in the vector."
  CorrectAnswer: mean(precip_mm)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mean(precip_mm)')
  Hint: The function you need is mean(), and the argument is your precipitation vector (in mm)
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Fascinating. In addition to the mean, we typically want to know the standard deviation. 
    In R, this function is shortened to `sd()`. Find the standard deviation of precipitation."
  CorrectAnswer: sd(precip_mm)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sd(precip_mm)')
  Hint: The function you need is sd(), and the argument is your precipitation vector (in mm)
  
- Class: text
  Output: "Its great to know exactly what our mean and standard deviation is, but what does this 
  look like? When getting a feel for our data, we almost always want to have a sense for the 
  distribution of our data. The way in which our measurements are distributed is a fundamental 
  property of any sample we might have, and many statistical tests assume data that resembles a 
  normal distribution i.e. a bell curve."
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "The quickest way to assess the distribution of our data is the histogram. In R, the 
  function is called `hist( )`. Go ahead and enter `hist(precip_mm)`."
  CorrectAnswer: hist(precip_mm)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='hist(precip_mm)')
  Hint: The function you need is hist(), and the argument is your precipitation vector (in mm)

- Class: text
  Output: "This is one way in which we can visualize the mean and variance in the data. 
  In this case, our data generally resemble a normal distribution (with a slight left skew), which 
  is great!"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "There are other ways in which we can summarize our data as well. Conveniently, there is a 
  function called `summary()`, which will give us a numeric breakdown of our vector. Go ahead and 
  summarize our precipitation vector."
  CorrectAnswer: summary(precip_mm)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='summary(precip_mm)')
  Hint: The function you need is summary(), and the argument is your precipitation vector (in mm)

- Class: text
  Output: "`summary()` returns statistics of central tendency (mean and median), spread 
  (1st and 3rd quartile), and range (min and max). Summary also works with different R 
  objects, such as statistical models, to summarize for us important information like model 
  coefficients and significance - we will return to this in the future. "
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Sometimes we just want specific values - not the entire summary. The functions `max()`, 
  `min()`, `median()`, and one we already learned (`mean()`) do this. Use `max()` to find the maximum 
  precipitation in our vector." 
  CorrectAnswer: max(precip_mm)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='max(precip_mm)')
  Hint: The function you need is max(), and the argument is your precipitation vector (in mm)
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now find the mininum."
  CorrectAnswer: min(precip_mm)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='min(precip_mm)')
  Hint: The function you need is min(), and the argument is your precipitation vector (in mm)
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now lets visualize this summary information. The function `hist()` displayed all
    the data in 'bins' (small groups). A boxplot (or box-and-whiskerplot) displays summary
    information based on the quartiles. R has this as the function `boxplot()`. Enter `boxplot(precip_mm)` now. "
  CorrectAnswer: boxplot(precip_mm)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='boxplot(precip_mm)')
  Hint: The function you need is boxplot(), and the argument is your precipitation vector (in mm)

- Class: text
  Output: "We now see much of the summary information as a graph. The middle line represents the 
  median (*not* the mean!). The median is actually the second quartile. The extents of the box are
  the 1st and 3rd quartiles. This is consistent across all boxplots." 
  
- Class: text  
  Output: "However, what the whiskers indicate can
  vary across software. In R, the whiskers display the highest and lowest value *excluding outliers*. In R, the whiskers
  are calculated as 1.5 * the interquartile range. Values beyond this are outliers and indicated by open circles.
  Now you know more about boxplots that most folks."
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "We can look at multiple sets of data with boxplot as well. Lets create two new objects. 
    The first will be the first 10 elements of our precip_mm vector. 
    Subset the vector for elements 1 to 10 and call it precip1."
  CorrectAnswer: precip1 <- precip_mm[1:10]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='precip1 <- precip_mm[1:10]')
  Hint: "Recall the subsetting vectors lesson if you don't remember how to do this. You'll need index brackets [ ], as well as your
  index 1 through 10, which you can use the `:` operator to create." 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now create a vector of elements 11-20 of precip_mm, and call it precip2."
  CorrectAnswer: precip2 <- precip_mm[11:20]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='precip2 <- precip_mm[11:20]')
  Hint: "Recall the subsetting vectors lesson if you don't remember how to do this. You'll need index brackets [ ], as well as your
  index 11 through 20, which you can use the `:` operator to create." 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now we can make our boxplot. Use the `boxplot()` function, but give it two arguments
    this time: precip 1 and precip2, separated by commas."
  CorrectAnswer: boxplot(precip1, precip2)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='boxplot(precip1, precip2)')
  Hint: Your command should be boxplot(precip1, precip2)
  
- Class: text
  Output: "We now have a boxplot for each subset of your vector! These types of visualizations are extremely useful for comparing
  differences between groups at a glance."
  
- Class: text
  Output: "We should note that these functions only work in this way for numeric data. We will 
  cover how to deal with character data when we start working with factors/categorical data. "
